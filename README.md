# MEDomics - Nature Communications Study

This repository provides the framework to reproduce the main experiments of the MEDomics manuscript submitted to <em>Nature Communications</em> in April 2024. Improvements from contributors are expected over time and will be identified via specific commit checkpoints. The exact results produced by this framework may eventually slightly differ from the original ones found in our study over the different checkpoints. 

## Using this repository

This repository is subdivided into thwo main high-level experiments:
* Figures: section used to illustrate the components of current Figures of the manuscript. 
* Database_Code: section used to build the multi-institutional database used in "Figures" folder.

Please follow the instructions in the README file of each section.
